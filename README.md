There are two versions of the project:
--------------------------------------

1. latest version

database, dialogs, etc.

2. old version (unsupported)

previous version of the project



To run this project:
--------------------
 
In both cases you need to run jar file in the resources directory.
 
1. (database version - latest one)

At first PostgreSQL Server is needed. Then it is crucial to create database named plang.
Run jar file using command:

java -jar plang(latest_ver).jar

2. (old version)

Just open the jar file.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------
 
- You also need base.txt file in both versions. (very simple one is provided in the same directory as jar file).

- In order to change base just replace base.txt file (WARNING! words should be in the same order
as before).

- As well as you need database.properties file, i.e:

jdbc.drivers=org.postgresql.Driver

jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql:plang

jdbc.username=postgres

jdbc.password=verysecretpassword
